# Extratonality

This was a side project for a technical writing class.  This project aimed to
classify the tonality of Beethoven's 9 symphonies by calculating the ratio of
notes played that were in and out of the written key signature.

The intial hypothesis was that Beethoven's later symphonies would have a higher
occurance of out-of-key ("extratonal") notes than his earlier works.  The results
shown here fail to prove this hypothesis, and in fact instead show strikingly
similar results throughout Beethoven's career.

The experiment wsa conducted by analyzing midi files of each movement of all of 
Beethoven's sypmhonies.  Midi files will not be provided on GitHub.
